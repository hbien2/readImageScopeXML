This is a simple Rust project to learn how to use Rust. I simply wanted to extract specific details from XML files generated by ImageScope and summarize them in a CSV compatible output. The same effect could be achieved much easier via grep/awk/sed and other similar tools. The coding is likely awkward and certainly not idiomatic but nevertheless serves as a learning exercise in how to code in Rust.
